# Churn Risk Analytics: Identifying and Preventing Customer Drop-Off

# Introduction 

Customer retention is a critical factor for the long-term success of any banking institution. This project focuses on predicting customer churn .The likelihood that a customer will leave the bank  by analyzing various customer attributes such as age, tenure, balance, product usage, and account activity. Using machine learning techniques, we aim to classify customers as potential churners or loyal clients. The data is extracted and explored using PostgreSQL, preprocessed and modeled in Python, and the results are visualized through interactive dashboards in Power BI. These dashboards highlight churn distribution, high-risk segments, and key drivers influencing churn. By understanding the patterns behind customer attrition, the bank can take proactive steps to retain valuable customers, improve service strategies, and optimize marketing efforts. This end-to-end project provides a data-driven approach to enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing churn rates in the competitive banking landscape.

# 	Data Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information on 10,000 bank customers, with 14 features including demographics, account activity, and financial status. Key columns include Age, Gender, Geography, Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, Credit Card status, and whether the customer is an active member. The target variable Exited indicates if the customer has churned. This structured dataset enables detailed exploratory analysis and supports predictive modeling to identify patterns and risk factors associated with customer attrition.
